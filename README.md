# PathfinderBand

Forked from: [FAangband](https://github.com/NickMcConnell/FAangband) 2.0.1 - First Age Angband is a variant of [Angband](http://angband.github.io/angband/).


I want to take First Age Angband as a starting point, and swap out Races, Classes and Enemies - and maybe more - for Pathfinder 1e content. It will be a difficult task of course, so i have no timeframe. For sure will take years.
